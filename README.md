## Applications of Data Structures

The project includes research on where data structures are used, such as:

- Arrays for data storage and indexing  
- Stacks for function calls and undo/redo operations  
- Queues for scheduling and service systems  
- Trees for file systems and databases  
- Graphs for networking and routing systems  
- Hash tables for fast searching and authentication  

Reasons for their usage are explained based on efficiency, speed, and memory management.
